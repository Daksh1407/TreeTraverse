## License

Nest is [MIT licensed](LICENSE).
=======

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Deep Tree Implementation with Next.js and NestJS

## Overview
This project implements a full-stack web application for managing and persisting a hierarchical tree structure using Next.js for the frontend and NestJS for the backend. The goal is to handle a tree with a depth of 10,000 nodes efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB (or your preferred database)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Deployment**: Docker (optional), Heroku (or your preferred hosting platform)

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

```
deep-tree/
├── backend/          # NestJS Backend
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── users/    # User management module
│   │   ├── tree/     # Tree management module
│   │   ├── app.module.ts
│   │   ├── main.ts
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
├── frontend/         # Next.js Frontend
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── index.tsx # Main page
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── TreeNode.tsx
│   │   ├── Tree.tsx
│   ├── public/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
├── .gitignore
├── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Setup and Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running (or your preferred database)

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure your MongoDB URI.

4. Start the NestJS server:
   ```
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Next.js development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Methodology

### Project Approach

The Deep Tree Implementation project follows a structured approach to develop a full-stack web application using Next.js and NestJS. The methodology integrates best practices in software development, ensuring robustness, scalability, and maintainability.

#### Agile Development

The project adopts Agile principles to facilitate iterative development and continuous improvement:

- **Sprints**: Organized into two-week sprints to achieve incremental progress and deliverables.
- **Daily Standups**: Conducted to review progress, discuss challenges, and plan the day's tasks.
- **Backlog Management**: Maintained to prioritize tasks and features based on user stories and project milestones.

### Detailed Steps

#### 1. Initial Setup

- **Next.js Setup**: Created a new Next.js project to serve as the frontend platform.
- **NestJS Setup**: Initialized a NestJS project for backend development.
- **Version Control**: Set up Git repository for collaborative version management.

#### 2. Frontend Structure

- **Component Development**: Implemented essential components like `TreeNode` and `Tree` using React.
- **User Interface**: Designed and integrated UI elements using CSS Modules for styling.

#### 3. Backend Architecture

- **NestJS Structure**: Established the basic project structure for efficient module management.
- **Database Integration**: Integrated MongoDB for data persistence, designed schemas for users and tree structures.

#### 4. Tree Data Management

- **Data Structure**: Implemented a hierarchical tree data structure capable of handling up to 10,000 nodes.
- **State Management**: Leveraged React Context API for managing complex state interactions across components.

#### 5. API Development

- **User Management APIs**: Developed API endpoints to manage user authentication, registration, and validation.
- **Tree Management APIs**: Implemented endpoints for saving and retrieving tree structures associated with user accounts.

#### 6. Frontend-Backend Integration

- **Secure Communication**: Established secure communication channels between frontend and backend using HTTPS.
- **API Consumption**: Implemented logic to send and receive data between frontend components and backend APIs.

#### 7. Performance Optimization

- **Efficiency Measures**: Optimized both frontend and backend code to ensure smooth performance with large data sets.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading techniques in the frontend to improve initial load times.

### Continuous Testing and Deployment

- **Unit Testing**: Conducted unit tests for critical components and APIs using Jest and Supertest.
- **Integration Testing**: Tested interactions between frontend and backend to ensure seamless functionality.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the application on Heroku (or your preferred platform) for continuous integration and delivery.


## Conclusion

The methodology employed in this project ensures a systematic approach to building a scalable and efficient tree management system. By following Agile principles and focusing on iterative development, the project aims to deliver a robust application that meets both functional and performance requirements.
